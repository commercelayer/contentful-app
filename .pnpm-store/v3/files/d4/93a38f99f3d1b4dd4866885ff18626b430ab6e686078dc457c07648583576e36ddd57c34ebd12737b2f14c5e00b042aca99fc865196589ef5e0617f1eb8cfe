# App SDK

The App SDK (formerly known as UI Extensions SDK) is a JavaScript library that allows developers to create custom Contentful Apps
for the Contentful Web App. Every Contentful App has to include the library in its source.

## Development

### Publishing

A new package version is automatically published to npm using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

To manually publish the package, run `npm run publish-all`.

This repository is published as two packages with identical data. We recommend using `@contentful/app-sdk`.

- `@contentful/app-sdk`
- `contentful-ui-extensions-sdk`

#### Canary releases

This package has two main development streams: `latest` and `canary`.

The default and stable releases are always published under the `latest` tag (as per npm convention).
The release under the `canary` tag is to be considered unstable and potentially breaking.
You should not rely on it in production.

### File Structure

#### `docs`

Former home of the documentation and reference for this library. This is now deprecated and you should use links above.

#### `lib`

Includes the files constituting the SDK and the associated types.

Top level files are split by feature. Most of them map 1-to-1 to an API (keep reading for the outliers). When APIs are
considered too small to be in a separate file, they are part of the [`api`](./lib/api.ts) file.

- [`channel`](./lib/channel.ts) and [`signal`](./lib/signal.ts) abstract the communication between an App and the host;
- [`locations`](./lib/locations.ts) exports available location where you can run App;
- [`initialize`](./lib/initialize.ts) creates an initializer to start an App within Contentful's App Framework.

All the typings are in the [`types`](./lib/types) folder and they map 1-to-1 APIs, when they make sense.
The [`entities`](./lib/types/entities.ts) file maps Contentful entities in TypeScript.
[`utils`](./lib/types/utils.ts) includes utility types, meant to save on characters to type.

#### `scripts`

Includes utility tools for maintainers.

#### `test`

Includes unit tests (run by [mocha](https://mochajs.org/))
